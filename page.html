        <p align="center"> Cyber Security awareness is the knowledge and understanding individuals have about protecting digital systems and data. It involves recognizing cyber threats, understanding associated risks, and adopting safe practices.

This awareness aims to defend both individuals and organizations from cyber incidents, typically nurtured through training and ongoing education.

This preparation is crucial in education since school districts are a treasure trove of personal data about staff, students, and their parents, making them a prime target for data breaches.

Additionally, most teachers are learning about several new technological platforms to perform their job, from teaching to grading and communicating with parents.

This type of situation is particularly dangerous from a cyber security standpoint since users might not be able to detect phishing or spoofing attempts due to being unfamiliar with the new platforms being introduced to them.</p>

    <h3 align="center">

        <p>A recent survey revealed that most K-12 schools devote less than 8% of their funding to cyber security. Cyber attacks against these educational institutions aim to initiate a data breach via either phishing, website spoofing, malware, or a combination of these tactics.

            Another common cyber attack in education is ransomware since schools are now heavily reliant on software to operate. Locking down their network can bring the entire institution to a crawl and force the administrators to comply with hackers’ demands.
        
        <h1>Phishing</h1>
        <p align="center">
            Education software is often centered around notifications sent to teachers, from work being submitted by students to new messages from parents. These notifications are almost always delivered via email, giving hackers a prime opportunity to mimic the emails sent by these platforms to trick teachers and school administrators into clicking on fraudulent links by mistake.</p>

        <h1>Safe Browsing Habits</h1>
        <p align="center"></p>
            Some tips for safe browsing of the Internet include:

            Visit only legitimate and trusted websites for safe and secure browsing
            Use discretion and follow safe practices to download files or software from the internet as well as accessing online services using personal information
            Use caution when sending and receiving emails, to protect from phishing & spamming 
            Be aware of the harm caused by inappropriate internet browsing
            Maintain Confidentiality on the Internet
            
            Cybercriminals also use the Internet to gather personal, confidential and financial information. 
            
            Many of the internet’s most popular services—email, social media, photo and video sharing—may be free, but that doesn’t mean they come without a cost. What appears to be free is paid for by the shared data. Cybercriminals will use the shared data to spam people with advertisements, other unsafe material, commit fraud, theft and to perform other illegal activities.
            
            The Internet is used for communication, networking, education and research, healthcare, financial transactions and other recreational activities like online games, videos etc..</p>

        <h1>Social Media Safety</h1>
        <P align="center">
            Follow these safety tips
            Given our average time on social media, now is as good as any time to check our security settings and protect our data with these quick tips:
            
            Always select the highest privacy settings. For example, make your page visible to your friends only by choosing the “Private Account” option available in your user settings.
            Enable two-factor authentication. Use two-factor authentication when available to prevent hackers from accessing your account. Most leading social media platforms offer this verification process as a simple way to enhance account protection.
            Disable location features. Turn off location services when not actively using them in a map app to help conceal your location from third parties.
            Choose a strong and unique password. Use a unique password that includes 8 to 12 letters, numbers, and symbols for each one of your social media accounts. Don’t repeat passwords and be sure to change your passwords regularly. You can also use a password manager, which will notify you if any stored login information is comprised.
            Avoid suspicious friend requests. Do not accept friend requests from strangers or duplicate friend requests.
            Understand your digital footprint. Consider what you post and who can access it.  
            Keep an eye out for scams. For example, never click on links or engage with unsolicited direct messages (DMs).
            Protect your kids. Criminals prey on kids using social media. Their personal information can be at risk if they are not updating their security settings.</P>

        <p>Cybersecurity Awareness Training
            K-12 schools have evolved to be more technologically inclined to provide better education to their students. Their new reliance on software has changed how teachers do their job and given them new responsibilities.
            
            Educators must lead by example by staying current on all cyber security trends. In most cases, a cyber security awareness program can dramatically reduce the impact of cyber attacks and often completely eliminate the potential risks.
            
            Here are the three aspects that K-12 schools should focus on when it comes to cyber security awareness:
            
            Password hygiene:
            Training teachers and administrators on the basics of password design is one of the most impactful steps toward a cyber security-aware culture. This practice protects you against brute force attacks and minimizes the ripple effects of a data breach.
            
            In conjunction with this training, make sure the platforms you use have some form of multi-factor authentication. This simple step can be extremely effective and is a relatively low-cost implementation.
            
            Phishing simulations:
            While phishing detection training is essential, nothing beats regular phishing simulations customized to the platforms your users work on every day. These tests will help you identify which users need additional attention while giving real-world practice to the ones who detect the cyber threat.
            
            Incident response plan:
            The survey mentioned earlier identified that over a third of K-12 schools lacked an incident response plan. This document can be very simple and drafted in a day, but it can have a tremendous impact in the event of a breach.
            
            Incident response plans are different for every situation and should be personalized for your needs. With cyber attacks, every minute counts, and users should know where and how to report any slip-ups.</p>
